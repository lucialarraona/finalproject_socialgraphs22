# Network Analysis of Food.com: Users, Recipes and Reviews ðŸ¥˜
Repo for the final project in Social Graphs @ DTU

## The motivation and goal 

_We want to discover connections between users, recipes and ingredients, and explore the reviews' text to get rid of unrated recipes. Finding a good recipe is our daily struggle, everyone has their favourite ingredients they are used to. We aim to use the data for a future recommender system based on the users reviews_ 

## The Data 

- The data we will use was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_interactions.csv
