# Analysis of National Dishes around the world ðŸ¥˜
Repo for the final project in Social Graphs @ DTU

## The motivation and goal 

_We want to discover connections between recipies and ingredients, and find the most common combinations of ingredients. Finding a good recipie is our daily struggle, everyone has their favourite ingredients they are used to. Our goal is to find recipies containing similar ingredients, to break the routine, but still be happy with the choice of the recipe. We also aim to use the data for a recommendation system based on the users reviews_ 

## The Data 

- The data we will use was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_interactions.csv
